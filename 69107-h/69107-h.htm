INTRODUCTION<br /></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span>HE HISTORIAN who, a couple of centuries hence, tries to get at the real
kernel of the great War, will find himself overwhelmed with material, buried
under evidence, like the great authority on Penguinia. Every doubtful
point will be clearly and irrefutably decided for him in at least seven different
ways. A burning sense of conviction may be his, but he will not be
sure which conviction it is. The lot of the historian has changed for the
worse since the days of Herodotus. It no longer suffices for an account
of a battle to be possible if not probable, marvellous if not possible, for it
to rank as history; mankind chose to start on the thorny quest of Truth,
and is now beginning to see that in every affair there are exactly as many
Truths as there are actors.</p>

<p>When the war broke out in August, 1914, the curious art of conveying
a knowledge of thoughts and fact between two or more human organisms,
the only art or appliance which man has really invented without referring
to Nature—the art of writing—was resorted to on every hand. An unprecedented
crop of war books began to sprout from the blood-fertilized fields
of Flanders. Men might safely exclaim: "Mine enemy hath written a
book"; they had perforce to add: "And so hath each of my friends."
They poured from the Press, little books and big, sober and hysterical,
speculative and emotional. After them came the sedate polychromatic
procession of Government literature. Along with them flowed the swift
and multitudinous efforts of journalism. And in a very short time began
those strange enterprises, at once droll and portentous, the Serial Histories
of the War.</p>

<p>What the great historian will make of all this when his time comes to
correlate it, it is difficult to say. If he feel conscientiously bound to consult
contemporary evidence, there is little hope for him, unless he takes the
bold step of writing a historical novel out of his inner consciousness instead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span></p>

<p>But there will be at least one unfailing guide for him. The very increase
in mechanical processes which contributes to his undoing in the matter of
books, will come to his aid with regard to pictures. Every great event
since the invention of mechanical reproductive processes has produced its
due reflection in the mirror of the artist. The crude old broadsheets told
their tale of the Napoleonic wars more vividly than any historian could;
and the present struggle, while it slew nearly every other art for the time
being, worked up to fever-pitch the output of pictorial comment. In
France, where this form of expression has always been popular, an unexampled
flood of cartoon and caricature poured from artists both celebrated
and unknown. Other countries followed suit, in proportion to their
national liking for prints; and the evidence supplied by this mass of international
material is as direct and reliable as anyone need demand.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">II.<br /></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span>HE VALUE of the contemporary cartoon is very great; for it deals almost
entirely with what people are feeling, in distinction to what they are doing.
It uses their deeds as a mere background to their emotions, and it is only
the emotions which count. What the soldier feels, the sailor, the mother
at home, the man in the street—these are the really important things, for
it is these things which are the causes of events. If enough ordinary
people want peace at any price, the Governments of all the States in the
world will be powerless to wage war one moment longer; if enough ordinary
people consider their honour involved in fighting to a finish, emperors
and kings and presidents and trade unions and the N.C.C. will united be
unable to break the smallest twig from the olive.</p>

<p>The material of the cartoonist is drawn from sources useless to the
writer, or at best, of only ephemeral utility. A chance-heard remark, the
expression of a face seen in the street, the glances turned on a wounded
man as he hobbles by on his stick, the ineptitude of a comment on the day's
news—these are the media by which the cartoonist conveys his view of
what his country feels. And he has this advantage over the writer—that a
well-done drawing is a volume in itself; in one glance the eye has absorbed
the background which a tedious explanation is necessary to convey in

<span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span>

words, and is free to take in the essential meaning of the drawing. A
picture appeals as directly to the eye as does a sunset, or as food to the
stomach, or a soft bed to the tired body. It uses a natural sense, not a
cultivated faculty.</p>

<p>Cartoons are meant for the man in the street; they are meant to tell a
story, to convey some feeling or idea rather than to be an artistic rendering
of an object or collection of objects. Therefore artistic canons apply to
them in this limited sense—that while the great cartoonist may and must
be as big an artist as he can, he must first of all remember that he has to
explain himself and his subjects, or he ceases to be a cartoonist at all. A
Futurist Forain, a Cubist Raemaekers, are inconceivable because they would
be quite useless as cartoonists, whatever they were as artists.</p>

<p>The artistic value of the cartoons issued in all countries—and in some
cases it is very great—is a matter for future discussion. It is of no present
importance. What is of some actual value is a comparison between the
cartoons of the various countries, for they show with unfailing accuracy the
trend of public opinion. From the human point of view this comparison
is invaluable to the student of humanity in the present upheaval. From
the cheap postcard to the twopenny broadsheet, from the most commonplace
poster to the finest lithograph, each has its place. To collect these
things is not only very interesting, but most enlightening; the national
spirit and the national moods of each country are unmistakably portrayed,
and the crudest production takes rank with the best as a human document.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">III.<br /></p>

<p><span class="xlarge">T</span>HE GOOD cause has always produced the good cartoonist—witness the
Napoleonic wars, when England rejoiced in Gillray and Rowlandson, while
France had no topical draughtsman of any outstanding merit. So far as
one can tell, this is very much the case with the present war. At any rate,
the good cause has produced its good men, and, judging by what one can
manage to see of German caricature, they have no mind of any large calibre
at work on cartoons. This is, perhaps, because the greater part of the
German drawings I have seen are intended to rouse hatred, scorn, and
anger. Clever they certainly are, but too many of them are spiritually

<span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span>

debased. The best are those directed against England, which are dedicated
to hatred, a passion greater than scorn or anger, and consequently more
elevating in its effects. Otherwise the German cartoonist has not distinguished
himself, in the sense that the war has not raised him above himself.</p>

<p>This can certainly not be said of France, where a crowd of new men
have appeared, and where the well-known draughtsmen of pre-war days
have been roused to unprecedented excellence by their emotions. At least
one of them, M. Forain, has made history with his pencil. There came a
time, when the first excitement had died away, when the victory of the
Marne had for months been followed by stagnation—stagnation in victory,
progress in casualties—a time when no news ever came, when Paris was
left in a kind of twilight of suspense and endurance, when the economic
pinch began to be acutely felt, when bereaved wives and mothers were told
in the morning that their loved ones "were gloriously dead for their
country," and read at night that "there is nothing to report on the front;
the night was calm." And for just a moment the human need and sorrow
of the individual cried louder than the pride of country. "It's very long,
this war!" "What I want to know is, how much more do they expect us
to endure?" "Could defeat be worse than war?" and even the sinister "if
we win," were phrases that crept into conversation. It was hardly to be
wondered at. France had expended so much energy on her magnificent
effort in August, '14, when her very babies bore themselves proudly and
with self-control, that she was bound to feel the reaction.</p>

<p>It did not last long, and it was Forain who swept it away by a dose of
strong tonic. He drew two French privates in a trench, snow and hail and
shrapnel raining round them, in conditions as bad as the most anxious
mother's nightmare could have pictured them. And one says: "If only
they hold out!" The other, with a look of great surprise, enquires:
"Who?" "Those civilians!" In a week that drawing was historic, and
civilian France, with a blush and a laugh, had pulled herself together.
M. Forain does not care to have his drawings reproduced, or this famous
cartoon would have been included in this book.</p>

<p>Nor, unfortunately, will M. Jean Véber have his cartoons reproduced

<span class="pagenum">[Pg ix]</span>

till after the war, which deprives us of that Napoleon of his, standing on
his own tomb and crying "Vive l'Angleterre," which created such a stir on
both sides of the Channel. "La Brûte est Lâchée," by the same artist, is
one of the most impressive drawings France has produced since the war.
Published so early as September, '14, it represents the Prussian monster,
madness and fury in his face, starting out like an unleashed animal on his
career of destruction.</p>

<p>This print was the first to indicate the enormous boom in war-drawings
which has characterized Paris. Published at 5 francs, it was within a few
months unobtainable under 500. Collectors took the hint, and the drawings
of Forain, Steinlen, and other well-known artists were eagerly sought
after, and rose to very high premiums. The character of the prints
changed; with the exception of M. Véber's series, the greater part of the
drawings published outside magazines and newspapers had been cheap,
ranging from threepence to two francs each, and including some publications
of deliberately naïve construction and crude colours, others which
achieved without deliberation a startling likeness to the old broadsheets
with their childlike simplicity. Postcards and prints fairly flooded Paris
in the first few months of the war, but since the collector appeared on the
scene in his dozens the cheaper publications have been displaced by more
ambitious works that range up to a hundred francs each, and have crowded
out the smaller artist, the smaller print-seller, and the smaller collector.</p>

<p>This variety of output has been increased by the publication of many
illustrated war-papers in Paris, such as <i>Le Mot</i>, <i>l'Europe Anti-Prussienne</i>,
<i>l'Anti-Boche</i>, <i>A la Baïonnette</i>, war editions of already established papers, and
a crop of crude halfpenny papers, printed after the Epinal manner, and
greatly used by children and the very low classes. A coloured history of
the war, of extraordinary naïveté, issued in penny sheets, was intended for
use in schools, but achieved an additional success in hospitals, where the
thin sheet was easily held and folded, and the incidents depicted roused
the liveliest interest among the wounded.</p>

<p>In the whole of this output it is difficult to find any sign of wavering
in the national spirit of France. Once the civilians had decided to hold

<span class="pagenum">[Pg x]</span>

out, there could be no other stumbling-block. Naturally, in such a range
of drawings, there are many that drop into brutality on the one hand, vulgarity
on the other; but the overwhelming majority breathe a spirit of calm,
determined endurance, with a ready laugh for hardships, a sly dig at politicians,
and no little irony at the expense of their own weaknesses and
foibles. Very often, so often as to set the key for the whole, the note is
heroic, sometimes grimly so. There is none of the splenetic fury of the
German drawings about the majority of the French ones; the Germans are
ridiculed and hated, it is true, but the spirit is more steady and less spiteful—it
rests on an emotion which for forty-five years has been a religion
to the Frenchman.</p>

<p>The English cartoons are as different as possible from both the French
and the German. We have no separately published prints, our postcards
have been few, vulgar, and negligible; our cartoonists are really only
offered the pages of newspapers and magazines in which to exert their
influence over us. And there cannot be two questions as to that influence—it
is the influence of good humour. The French mistake it sometimes
for indifference, but the English know better. The Germans say they
mistake it for frivolity, but they so foam at the mouth about it that one
suspects them of glimpsing the spirit behind the smile. The grim note of
Steinlen and Forain is almost wholly wanting from English cartoons. The
Kaiser, who is a devil in France, is merely making an unholy fool of himself
in England; the Crown-Prince, a mass of vice in Paris, is "an awful
silly blighter" in London. Will Dyson, the young artist of whom
Australia has such reason to be proud, is our grimmest product, and even
he lets the Prussian off more easily than do the French artists. Because,
after all, don't you know, we're going to thrash the brutes, but there's no
need to make a fuss about it, hang it all. Let us have our pipe and our
grin, and let us keep to those till the end. For the Lord's sake don't let
us have any heroics—those are for doing, not for showing. That is the attitude
which one finds over and over again in English drawings; not contempt
of danger, so much as a serene determination to grin at it and have no fuss.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> has come out brilliantly in this particular. Allowed by tradition

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xi]</span>

to have two heroic cartoons a week, the rest of his pages are dedicated to
the god of laughter. Germany reads <i>Punch</i> with stupefaction. What, we
not only laugh at the Germans, we laugh more at the English! Extraordinary,
sinister, effete, degenerate race! It is true, we laugh at ourselves
far more than at anybody else—and very often it is for that painful but
cogent reason, that we may not weep. Perhaps at the front they laugh
wholeheartedly at <i>Punch</i>; at home it is a different laugh that greets
Tommy in his imperturbable good-humour. In the midst of a hell of fire,
Tommy says that what with the beastly Belgian tobacco and the blooming
French matches, this'll be the death of him. Sitting on the edge of a
trench which consists of nothing but mud and water, in a fearful downpour,
he remarks that he pities the poor fellows at home—the London streets
must be something awful! And on a dozen other occasions he has expressed
that cheery soul of his, in a way as charming as it is moving.</p>

<p>As for the Germans, perhaps Mr. Punch reached his happiest moment
when he gave us the German family "enjoying its morning hate." A
French paper copied that with enjoyment tinged with bewilderment, since
the idiomatic "morning hate" was beyond the French editor, who published
it merely as "a study of a German family at breakfast time". The Germans
have not published it at all.</p>

<p>Nothing more light-hearted and good-humoured than Mr. Heath
Robinson's fantastic inventions (such as the Tatcho bomb) could be found—unless
perhaps, in the inimitable "Big and Little Willie" of Mr. Haselden,
which have given pleasure to countless people, at the front and at home,
and have caused howls of Majestätsbeleidigungisch laughter in German
trenches, when Tommy has been so kind as to throw a copy over.</p>

<p>England has never taken cartoons so seriously as has France, nor
has she a public for separate topical prints; but she has done as much
as she can, for her war cartoons accurately express her mind, and that is
their real function and constitutes their real value.</p>

<p>Neutral countries have had to be careful in some ways; it is difficult to
find any interesting war-prints or postcards on sale there. What there are

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xii]</span>

are rather insipid, at any rate to the Allied mind. But in individual newspapers
and periodicals the struggle has raged fiercely by pen and pencil,
pro-Ally or pro-German. Mr. Robert Carter, for instance, in his drawings
in the <i>New York Evening Sun</i>, has spoken with no uncertain voice, as one
of his cartoons in this book will witness. Spain has had more pro-Ally
cartoons than one might have expected, Scandinavia has been very discreet—Italy
never was, even before she came in.</p>

<p>Holland remains, and well has she shown that she still possesses that
spirit of resistance to the oppressor which dictated the pages of her superb
history. Small in size, in a geographical position of great danger, her economic
interests very largely identified with the welfare of Germany,
Holland might have been excused for holding her peace. Everyone knew
that German influence was, and is, very important in Holland; that the
Netherlands reek with German espionage, and that method of commercial
penetration which is one of Prussia's most valued weapons. Yet none of
these things sufficed to silence the Dutch love of liberty and hatred of
oppression. A band of Dutch cartoonists, hot with indignation, took the
bit between their teeth, and ran away with their pencils, their papers,
their public, and, if their startled Government is right, very nearly with
Dutch neutrality. Anyone who has watched Dutch drawings must have
been impressed by the fire of the pro-Ally artists, Braakensiek, Albert
Hahn, Peter van den Hem, and Lazrom. Neutrality is too pale for them.</p>

<p>And, of course, there is Louis Raemaekers. Only a neutral could have
done what he has done; but it might not have been done at all had not
Raemaekers arisen with his accusing pencil. In his work the war takes on
its right colour, as something far above international hatreds or the struggle
of policies, far above even a battle for the welfare of peoples whose
interests are opposed. It appears in its right aspect, as a spiritual conflict,
more deadly, more earnest, more vital, than any revolution or reformation
or war since that struggle in which proud Lucifer fell. This is every man's
war, the world's war, the war of God and devil. And, taking this heroic
view of it, Raemaekers has stepped into the rôle of Tragedy, which is "to
arouse pity and terror, and the noble movements of the soul." His

<span class="pagenum">[Pg xiii]</span>

"Prisoners" and "Barbed Wire" (Plates XXII. and XXIII.) show well his
detached, tragic quality. There are many of his drawings which are too
dreadful to be contemplated for long—"Slow Gas Poisoning," the German
thief trampling in blood that drops from his heavy sack, the professor and
the devil leering delightedly into each other's eyes. But after such horrors
one comes always back to the exquisite tenderness which is the real distinguishing
characteristic of Raemaekers. The young German soldier who
writes home that "our cemeteries now stretch nearly to the sea" is as
tenderly drawn as are the widows of Belgium. The tenderness of strength
is the heart of the tragic spirit, the heart that bleeds for suffering and
weakness, the heart that grows hot for injustice and wrong. It is this
spirit, with its heart of tenderness, that has made the fame of Raemaekers.
It is not comfortable nor pleasant to be roused to the tragic sentiments,
but it is right that we should; and had the Allies needed any reassurance
as to the nature of the reason for which they fight, Raemaekers' work would
have supplied it. The good cause has found its good artist, and he is all
the stronger because he is a neutral. Like Truth in the cartoon with
which this book closes, he has held up the mirror to the Prussian, and we
can see, Germany can see, the whole world can see, what kind of soul is
reflected therein.</p>

<p class="p4">French satire has not devoted itself entirely to our
enemies, but has been frequently turned on France.
There are comedy and irony, perhaps even pathos,
in Albert Guillaume's cartoon in<i> Le Rire Rouge</i>
of the fair and probably frail lady who replies to
the Sister of Mercy's request for clothes for the
refugees: "Certainly, Sister. Françoise, bring me
my pink dress with silver sequins. Do you mind
it's being slit up at one side, Sister? It does rather
date it."</p>

the war took him from his observation of

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
